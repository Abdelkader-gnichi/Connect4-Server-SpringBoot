# Connect4 Game SpringBoot server

Welcome to the ConnectX game server-side repository! This project is implemented using the Spring Boot framework to serve as the game judge, controlling and tracking the game state. The server communicates with the client interfaces, notifying players of game events such as wins, losses, resets, and exits.

Feel free to check out the [Connect4 Game-client side](https://github.com/Abdelkader-gnichi/Connect4-Client-Java-JavaFx) repository to explore the client-side of the game in Java and JavaFx. Enjoy using it!
